## [0.1.0] - 21-Nov-2020

So... another couple of release notes missing! 😅 What's important?

- Added NURBS support in curves and surfaces.
- Added some spatial search algorithms.
- Improved testing and coverage.

## [0.0.6] - 14-June-2020

Yup! Versioning is hard... I didn't do a good job of keeping track of the changes, so version `0.0.2 -> 0.0.6` will go under the *"major improvements"* category. I promise to do better next time! 🤞🏻

## [0.0.1] - 10-Feb-2020

Initial beta release with many many many things pending implementation still. Just main structure and functionality in place.
